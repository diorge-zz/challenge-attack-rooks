# Attack Rooks
This is a solution to the Attack Rooks problem proposed by ACM-ICPC.
It is a variant of the N-Queens problem, but with Rooks and blocking pawns.

## Problem description
Given a NxN (N > 0) chess board containing some pawns, output the highest
possible number of rooks that can be put in this board without any rook being
able to capture each other.
